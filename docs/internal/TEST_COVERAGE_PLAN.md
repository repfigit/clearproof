# Full test coverage work plan

Objective: full test coverage. Passing the existing tests alone is insufficient.
Measure all application source, inspect missed branches and skipped tests, and
exercise every supported test layer with its required local dependencies.

## Completion evidence required

- Python line and branch reports covering all `src` modules, including modules
  that tests never import. Report generated protobuf coverage separately when
  evaluating authored code; do not silently remove it from the inventory.
- TypeScript line, branch and function reports for every source workspace.
- Solidity instrumented coverage plus uninstrumented real-proof verification.
- Actual Circom witness and proof tests for supported profiles, including
  adversarial inputs. No generated development proving keys committed.
- PostgreSQL and local EVM integration tests, including restart, concurrency,
  rollback, expiry, authorization and tampering behavior.
- An inventory of every skipped/conditional test and evidence that each required
  environment-dependent path has run. Test count is not coverage percentage.
- CI runs the relevant tests and retains reproducible coverage evidence. Gates
  must not claim full coverage while untested behavior remains.

## Work sequence

1. Repair legacy PostgreSQL stores and obsolete fixtures; isolate each test's
   schema and include the suite in the existing PostgreSQL CI job.
2. Establish measured baselines with real local services and development proof
   artifacts, and inventory missing source/workspace coverage.
3. Add meaningful tests for uncovered behavior, prioritizing integrity,
   authorization and persistence. Fix defects those tests demonstrate.
4. Exercise CLI commands and external-component boundaries with controlled
   local dependencies. Include all source files in coverage denominators.
5. Run every supported layer, inspect residual branches/skips, and add CI
   reporting/gates that accurately reflect the achieved coverage.
6. Review, run remote checks, merge after clean checks, and verify merged main.

## Evidence so far (not completion)

- Legacy storage: 15 real PostgreSQL tests pass after tuple mapping, rowcount,
  timestamp conversion, fixture isolation and valid proof/nullifier setup fixes.
- SDK baseline: 372/400 lines (93%); 605/671 branches (90.16%).
- CLI baseline: 112/432 lines (25.92%); 115/238 branches (48.31%).
- Python: 1124 passed in the full run; the one skipped checkpoint test passed
  separately on its owned local EVM. Combined line coverage: 7161/8289 (86.39%);
  branch coverage: 1512/2046 (73.90%). Generated sources remain in this report.
- Expanded SDK tests: 187 passed, 382/400 lines (95.5%), 621/671 branches (92.54%).
- Expanded CLI tests: 51 passed, 144/432 lines (33.33%), 129/238 branches (54.2%).
- Solidity: 87 passed; 89.3% lines, 54.39% branches. A deployment child process
  previously overwrote instrumented artifacts; `--no-compile` repairs that
  measurement without omitting deployment tests.

## Next uncovered behavior to address

Python: SIWE authentication, chain audit mirror/writer, issuer registry, snarkjs
prover, gRPC failure paths, keyring rotation, API startup/shutdown and proof route
error paths. The combined baseline still has 1128 missed lines and 534 missed
branches. Subprocess coverage must also be captured before interpreting child
CLI modules as unexecuted.

CLI: prove/verify/demo, discovery commands, historical verification, rendering,
recipes/help/explain and remaining doctor/policy/investigation branches.

Solidity: router administration/timelocks, oracle updates, VASP administration,
registry validation failures and cryptographic rejection branches. Retest normal
uninstrumented bytecode as well as instrumentation; generated coverage factory
bytecode must not be committed.

These figures describe an intermediate worktree, not a released coverage claim.
The full goal remains open.

Content/docs: measure parser, topic, recipe and signal modules; test docs routes
and rendering. Existing content tests check recipe text only. Browser/server
behavior and operational scripts remain part of the coverage inventory.
